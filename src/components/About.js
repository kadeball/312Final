                    Founded in 2019, Manthaniel Icereamo wanted ice cream to be super all the time.
                    He used the same stuff that makes rubber duckies cry to make it taste so good. Our locally-owned and operated ice cream shop blends together the freshest, finest ingredients to create unique and delicious super-premium flavors that we know youâ€™ll CRAVE!
                    Combined with friendly locals and lake visitors, you get the best combination of hand-dipped ice cream and family-centered service in town.
                    We serve over 24 hand-crafted ice cream flavors and offer several options for toppings, including hot fudge & caramel, your favorite candies, syrups and more.
                    Shakes, malts, sundaes and banana splits are also in our lineup of mouthwatering treats. Like any celebration, no party is complete without a cake!
                    Our ice cream cakes are available in any of our flavors and can be ordered in advance of your event.
